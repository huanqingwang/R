Hi there!
Currently here is a place for me to record and share the R codes which I use for analyzing data of psychology experiment.  
Although these analyzes are not advanced, they do satisfy the basic needs. Hope these can help you!  
Suggestions for debugging or optimizing are welcomed.  
The following are the functions that have already been achieved (I am continually updating).  
ANOVA (multiple factors multiple levels within subject analyze).  
Multiple comparisons & simple effect analyze
