As shown in the figure, we have two independent variables, each row records a participant's performance in each level's combination.
  
  
## Result of linear regression (step-wise)

As shown in the figure, the result will return unstandardized coefficients, standardized coefficients, p value of each regression model.

Command 'lm' also return model summery, in which we can judge which model can more efficiently predict the dependent variable. As can see from the figure, in this case, model 2 is better.
